<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Challenge

There are two parts to the challenge this year - [a front-end challenge](/FRONTEND) and a [back-end challenge](/BACKEND). You only need to do **one** of them, but if you would like, consider implementing both challenges as part of a full stack application.

Please note that we are only looking for effort, and that your solution is just a part of our discussion with you during the interview so don't worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesn't work, submit it anyways, we want to see it!

For the front-end challenge, you are tasked to build the pagination feature for Star Wars University's new face book.

For the back-end challenge, you are tasked to build a robust data structure that can handle string queries for a fictional online learning service.

The challenge is due at **Wednesday May 25th, 9:00 AM**. Your submission must be done through GitHub issues, more details about submission can be found in the individual challenge README files.

Good luck and have fun!
